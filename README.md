## My Story
 
The first time dealing with Algorithm( [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) ), I stuck in for three weeks. Read articles, Understood the algorithm, Had no idea how to apply it in Javascript. This was the project not only need logic but also some mathematic knowledge. It was very challenge for me. 
Here is a helpful [link](https://blog.vivekpanyam.com/how-to-build-an-ai-that-wins-the-basics-of-minimax-search/) that helped me to integrate the theory into javascript. 
My Tic Tac Toe game is still a little bit slow when AI is making the first step.
